# EMC Calculator

## Features
* Determine how much EMC an item takes to create
* Convert EMC to equivalent resource values
* Create custom EMC systems
* FInd loopholes in your EMC system and get suggestions on how to solve them
* Looks nice

## Current Limitations
* An item can only have one recipe, as to not cause conflicting value answers.
* Recursive recipes will break it, even though I think Minecraft lets you have those.
* All recipes must collapse into items with raw values eventually.
